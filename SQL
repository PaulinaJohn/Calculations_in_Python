## I was trying to create a fresh schema for the supplies table in the jeff supplies dataset and correct a mispelled entry in the supplier column 
SELECT
  *,
  CASE WHEN supplier = 'Inflatibles Plos' THEN 'Inflatibles Plus'
  ELSE supplier
  END AS supplier_new
FROM 
Jeff_supplies.supplies

SELECT
  DISTINCT supplier_new
FROM
  Jeff_supplies.temp_supplies;
